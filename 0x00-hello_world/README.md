This project is a transitional project. It introduces us to GCC and C while having us work with shell script for the first few tasks so that we can gently move from one scripting to C programming.

0 - A script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the results into another file.

1 - A script that compiles a C file but does not link.

2 - A script that generates assembly code of a C file and saves it in an output file.

3 - A script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.

4 - A C program that prints a quote using the puts function.

5 - A C program that prints a quote using the printf function.

6 - A C program that prints the size of data types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
