In this project, we work mainly with C by solving tasks to get a better understanding of the C language file formatting. We also learn how to use while loop to understand how loops work and work with "if...else" statements to learn how to modify the condition of our loop. Using mainly putchar paired with while loops, it helps us better understand loops and how printf and puts potentially work under the hood.

0 - A program that will print whether the variable n is positive, negative, or is 0. Variable n is a rgn and will be a different value every time the program is ran.

1 - A program that prints the last digit of variable n which is a rgn. The program will determine whether the last digit of n is greater than 5, is 0, or if it is less than 6 and not 0.

2 - A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase.

3 - A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase then in uppercase.

4 - A program that prints the alphabet except for q and e in lowercase.

5 - A program that prints all single digit number of base 10 starting from 0.

6 - A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0 using a different method.

7 - A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase in reverse order.

8 - A program that prints the number of base 16 in lowercase.

9 - A program that prints all possible combinations of single digit numbers.

10 - A program that prints the number 00 to 99.
