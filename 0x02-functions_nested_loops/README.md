In this project, we learn how to work with nested loops. We also learn about function prototypes and what the difference between a function and a function prototype is. Another thing we learn is about header files. Inside it, we place all our function prototypes inside and include this header file we made ourselves with each of our source files. Instead of writing programs, we are now working with writing functions.

0 - A program that prints a string followed by a new line.

1- A function that prints the alphabet in lowercase.

2 - A function that prints the alphabet 10 times.

3 - A function that checks for lowercase characters.

4 - A function that checks for alphabetic characters.

5 - A function that prints the sign of a number.

6 - A function that computes the absolute value of an integer.

7 - A function that prints the last digit of a number.

8 - A function that prints every minutes of the day starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

9 - A function that prints the multiplication from 0-9.

10 - A function that adds two numbers and returns the result.

11 - A function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98.
