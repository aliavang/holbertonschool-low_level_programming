In this project, we learn how to debug our programs. By learning how to debug our programs and functions, we are better able to understand the logic behind what is happening inside our code. Debugging is an important thing to know because if your program is broken and not functioning properly, it is up to you to find out what is going wrong inside your code. In the process of debugging, you will come to understand more what you wish for your code to achieve and you will also better understand why your code executes the way it does.
