In this project, we are given more tasks with nested loops to work with. Although the main focus is nested loops, we are given some tasks that deals with single loops. In doing so, this is bringing us back to the basics of one single loop so that we do not forget the simple task of loops which is to loop through until the condition is no longer true. We also learn how to use nested loops to print out shapes such as a square and a triangle.

0 - A function that checks for uppercase characters.

1 - A function that checks for digits 0-9.

2 - A function that multiples two numbers.

3 - A function that prints out the numbers 0-9.

4 - A function that prints out the numbers 0-9 excluding 2 and 4.

5 - A function that prints 0-14 ten times.

6 - A function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

7 - A function that draws a diagonal line in the terminal.

8 - A function that prints a square.

9 - A program that prints out Fizz for multiples of 3 and Buzz for multiples of 5 and FizzBuzz for multiples of 3 and 5.

10 - A function that prints a triangle.
