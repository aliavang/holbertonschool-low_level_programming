In this project, we work with pointers, arrays, and strings. The focus of this project is to help us see how pointers function. We are also working with arrays and strings to help familiarize us with how to handle them when given to us.

0 - A function that takes a pointer to an int and updates its value.

1 - A function that sweeps the values of two integers.

2 - A function that returns the length of a string.

3 - A function that prints a string to stdout.

4 - A function that prints a string in reverse.

5 - A function that reverses a string.

6 - A function that prints every other character of a string.

7 - A function that prints half the string.

8 - A function that prints n elements of an array.

9 - A function that copies a string to a buffer.
