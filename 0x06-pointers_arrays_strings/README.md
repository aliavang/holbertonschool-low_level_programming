In this project, we continue to work with pointers, arrays, and strings. We learn how to manipulate strings by passing them through as pointers to our functions.

0 - A function that strings two strings together.

1 - A function that strings to strings together up to n bytes from the second string.

2 - A function that copies a string.

3 - A function that compares 2 strings.

4 - A function that reverses the content of an array of integers.

5 - A function that changes all lowercase into uppercase.

6 - A function that capitalizes all words of a string.

7 - A function that turns a string into 1337.

8 - A function that changes a string into rot13.
