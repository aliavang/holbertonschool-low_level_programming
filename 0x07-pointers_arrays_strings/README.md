In this project, we work mainly with pointers. However, we are introduced to pointer-to-pointers and 2d arrays. We are tasked with one or two problems that deal with them to help us understand how they are used and how they function.

0 - A function that fills memory with a constant byte.

1 - A function that copies memory area.

2 - A function that locates a character in a string.

3 - A function that gets the length of a prefix substring.

4 - A function that searches a string for a set of bytes.

5 - A function that locates a substring.

6 - A function that prints the chessboard.

7 - A function that prints the sum of two diagonals of a square matrix.

8 - A function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.
