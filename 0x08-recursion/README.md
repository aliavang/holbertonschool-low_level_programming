In this project, we deal with recursion. Learning about recursion helps us to understand the difference between a function calling itself and how iterating through something are different even though they produce the same results. It also helps to build a sense of when to use recursion versus iterating through something.

0 - A function that prints a string followed by a newline.

1 - A function that prints a string in reverse.

2 - A function that returns the length of a string.

3 - A function that returns the factorial of a given number.

4 - A function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.

5 - A function that returns the natural square root of a number.

6 - A function that returns 1 if the input number is a prime number and a 0 if otherwise.

7 - A function that returns a 1 if the string is a palindrome and 0 if otherwise.
