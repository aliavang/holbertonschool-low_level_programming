In this project, we are introduced to argc and argv. We learn how to manipulate what is happens with our program that takes arguments from the command line by modifying our conditions to meet our needs.

0 - A program that prints its name and will print its new name without having to recompile.

1 - A program that prints the number of arguments passed to it.

2 - A program that prints all arguments it receives.

3 - A program that multiples two numbers.

4 - A program that adds positive numbers.
