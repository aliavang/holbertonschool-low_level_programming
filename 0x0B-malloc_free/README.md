In this project, we learn how to allocate space using malloc. We also learn how to allocate enough space for our parameters and how to free them before exiting our functions.

0 - A function that creates an array of chars and initializes it.

1 - A function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.

2 - A function that concatenates two strings.

3 - A function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.

4 - A function that frees a 2 dimensional array previously created by one of our previous function.

5 - A function that concatenates all arguments of the program.
