In this project, we go over the preprocessor step of the gcc process and learn about macros and how to implement macros. We also have tasks that have us create macros and use them to build our function. It is helpful to learn about macros so that we do not have to constantly define the same thing over and over again and can simply use our definition across function files.

0 - A header file that defines a macro named SIZE with the value of 1024.

1 - A header file that defines a macro named PI with the value of 3.14159265359.

2 - A program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from.

3 - A function-like macro that computes the absolute value of x.

4 - A function-like macro that computes the sum of x + y.
