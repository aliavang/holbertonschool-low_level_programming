In this project, we learn about structures and how to create them as well as implement and modify them. The reason we learn about structures is because they are very useful for when we have to make multiple of the same criterias, therefore, it would be easier to make one structure and modify it as needed. Examples where structures are useful would be something like creating a file for an employee.

0 - Define a new type struct dog with specified criteria.

1 - A function that initializes a variable of type struct dog.

2 - A function that prints a struct dog.

3 - Define type struct dog with alias dog_t.

4 - A function that creates a new dog.

5 - A function that frees dogs.
