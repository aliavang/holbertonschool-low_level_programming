In this project, we work with variadic functions. To learn how to take in a variable amount of arguments, we are given tasks to solve to understand how variadic functions. The reason we are learning about variadic funtions is to help us solve the case in which we have an undefined amount of arguments we wish to take, but cannot declare them in the parameter at the moment because we do not know how many arguments they will be until the user enters them. It is also setting the foundations to help us understand how printf works.
