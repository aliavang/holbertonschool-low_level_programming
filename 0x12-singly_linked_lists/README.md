In this project, we work with linked lists. We learn how to access the elements inside our linked lists as well as how to add nodes and how to free the list. We also learn what makes a linked list and what is needed to make a linked list.

0 - A function that prints all elements of the list.

1 - A function that returns the number of elements in a linked list.

2 - A function that adds a new node at the beginning of the list.

3 - A function that adds a new node at the end of the list.

4 - A function that frees the list.
