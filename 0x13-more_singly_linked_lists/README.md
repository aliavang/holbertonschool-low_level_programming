In this project, we work more with singly linked lists. They are important to know because they are not size limited like arrays and modifying the size of a list is easier when using linked lists.

0 - A function that prints all elements of a list.

1 - A function that returns the number of elements in a list.

2 - A function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list.

3 - A function that adds a new node at the end of a list.

4 - A function that fress a list.

5 - A function that frees a list.

6 - A function that deletes a head node and return its data.

7 - A function that returns the nth node.

8 - A function that returns the sum of all data in list.

9 - A function that inserts a new node at a given position.

10 - A function that deletes a node at n index of a list.
