In this learn how to manipulate bits. We also learn how to convert numbers into different bases such as: base 2, base 10, and base 16.

0 - A function that converts binary to an unsigned int.

1 - A function that the binary representation of a number.

2 - A function that returns the value of a bit at given index.

3 - A function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at given index.

4 - A function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at given index.

5 - A function that returns the number of bits needed to be flipped to get from one number to another.
