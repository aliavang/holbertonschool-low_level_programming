In this repository, we learn all about C.

## Project 0x00-hello_world
This project introduces us to C and the process of GCC. It includes both shell script and C programming so that we can work with something we are familiar with before transitioning over to C. The shell scripts deals with the GCC process while the C programming we do transitions us to writing in the language of C.

## Project 0x01-variables_if_else_while
This project takes us deeper into the language of C. We begin coding more in C and no longer deal with shell scripts. In this project, we learn how to work with while loops and how to declare variables as well as how to assign them values.
