# holbertonschool-low_level_programming
In this repository, we learn all about C.

## [Project 0x00-hello_world](https://github.com/aliavang/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x00-hello_world)
This project introduces us to C and the process of GCC. It includes both shell script and C programming so that we can work with something we are familiar with before transitioning over to C. The shell scripts deals with the GCC process while the C programming we do transitions us to writing in the language of C.

## [Project 0x01-variables_if_else_while](https://github.com/aliavang/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while)
This project takes us deeper into the language of C. We begin coding more in C and no longer deal with shell scripts. In this project, we learn how to work with while loops and how to declare variables as well as how to assign them values.

## [Project 0x02-functions_nested_loops](https://github.com/aliavang/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops)
This project takes us even deeper into loops by having us work with nested loops. Although we had two mandatory tasks in the previous project that dealt with nested loops, this project will focus solely on nested loops, bringing us into the complexity that nested loops can create. We also briefly deal with header files by creating on which includes all our functions we use in the project.

## [Project 0x03-debugging](https://github.com/aliavang/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x03-debugging)
This project takes us into debugging our programs. Here, we learn how to go into our code and see where our code is going wrong. In doing so, we go behind the code and see the logic that is being performed to give us the correct output that we are searching for. We learn how to manually debug our code by following the logic and how to take a close look at our code.
