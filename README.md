In this repository, we learn all about C.

Project 0x00-hello_world introduces us to C and the process of GCC. The project includes both shell script and C programming so that we can work with something we are familiar with before transitioning over to C. The shell scripts deals with the GCC process while the C programming we do transitions us to writing in the language of C.
