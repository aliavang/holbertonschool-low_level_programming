# holbertonschool-low_level_programming
In this repository, we learn all about C.

## [Project 0x00-hello_world](https://github.com/aliavang/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x00-hello_world)
This project introduces us to C and the process of GCC. It includes both shell script and C programming so that we can work with something we are familiar with before transitioning over to C. The shell scripts deals with the GCC process while the C programming we do transitions us to writing in the language of C.

## [Project 0x01-variables_if_else_while](https://github.com/aliavang/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while)
This project takes us deeper into the language of C. We begin coding more in C and no longer deal with shell scripts. In this project, we learn how to work with while loops and how to declare variables as well as how to assign them values.

## [Project 0x02-functions_nested_loops](https://github.com/aliavang/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops)
This project takes us even deeper into loops by having us work with nested loops. Although we had two mandatory tasks in the previous project that dealt with nested loops, this project will focus solely on nested loops, bringing us into the complexity that nested loops can create. We also briefly deal with header files by creating on which includes all our functions we use in the project.

## [Project 0x03-debugging](https://github.com/aliavang/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x03-debugging)
This project takes us into debugging our programs. Here, we learn how to go into our code and see where our code is going wrong. In doing so, we go behind the code and see the logic that is being performed to give us the correct output that we are searching for. We learn how to manually debug our code by following the logic and how to take a close look at our code.

## [Project 0x04-more_functions_nested_loops](https://github.com/aliavang/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops)
This project deals with more nested loops. Here, we are using nested loops to do various tasks for us such as printing tables and triangles. There are a few tasks that do not deal with nested loops, instead, it tasks us with single loops which brings us back to the basic of loops and what it does. By doing so, it refreshes our memories so that we do not forget what one single loop does versus two loops, with one nested inside the other.

## [Project 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings](https://github.com/aliavang/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings)
This project brings us into pointers, arrays, and strings. Building on our knowledge of loops and nested loops, we begin handling strings, arrays, and pointers as parameters. By working with pointers as our parameters, we learn that, while the concept of pointers is abstract, it is the same as being passed any kind of parameter. The difference is that we are not copying the parameters into our function, we are working directly with their value via being passed a pointer to them.

## [Project 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings](https://github.com/aliavang/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings)
This project focuses on more pointers, arrays, and strings. We build up on our knowledge from the previous project and work more with pointers.

## [Project 0x07-pointers_arrays_strings](https://github.com/aliavang/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings)
This project brings us more pointers. Although most of the tasks deal with pointers, we work a little with pointers-to-pointers and 2d arrays. Here, we expand our knowledge of pointers by learning what pointers to pointers are. Tossed in with pointers-to-pointers, are 2d arrays to demonstrate why pointer-to-pointers are used.

## [Project 0x08-recursion](https://github.com/aliavang/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x08-recursion)
This project introduces us to recursion. The tasks we are given are all done recursively. Learning recursion helps us to differentiate between recursion and iteration. Aside from that, it helps us learn what the pros and cons of doing things recursively and via iterations are.

## [Project 0x09-static_libraries](https://github.com/aliavang/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x09-static_libraries)
This project teaches us how to create our very own static library. It also teaches us why static libraries are useful and how to implement them after creating them. Using static library helps cut the time it takes to compile our files by utilizing the object files contained within our static library.

## [Project 0x0A-argc_argv](https://github.com/aliavang/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x0A-argc_argv)
This project introduces us to taking arguments from the command line and teaches us how to use those arguments in our functions. It also teaches us how to void parameters that we do not need to use.

## [Project 0x0B-malloc_free](https://github.com/aliavang/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x0B-malloc_free)
This project focuses on malloc and what malloc does. It also teaches us how to use malloc and why malloc is useful to know how to use. Given strings, we are to malloc space for them and are to copy them over to the new space. We also work with pointers alongside malloc.

## [Project 0x0C-more_malloc_free](https://github.com/aliavang/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x0C-more_malloc_free)
This project brings us more tasks that deals with malloc. However, in this project, we deal more with the free function and learn how to free appropriately and to solve memory leaks. This project demonstrates the importance of freeing after malloc.

## [Project 0x0D-preprocessor](https://github.com/aliavang/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x0D-preprocessor)
In this project, we are introduced to macros and how to declare them in our header files. We are given tasks that give us macros to create. This project also gives us tasks to create macros that function like functions to demonstrate that macros can be defined to behave like functions.

## [Project 0x0E-structures_typedef](https://github.com/aliavang/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x0E-structures_typedef)
In this project, structures are introduced to us. We learn that structures are very useful and popular. They contain a collection of many different data types and can be copied to be used to contain different values while still containing the same criteria.

## [Project 0x0F-function_pointers](https://github.com/aliavang/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x0F-function_pointers)
In this project, we learn about function pointers. They are useful because they help you cut down on code redundancy. Aside from learning about them, we work with them and learn how to declare function pointers and how to use them. This project expands on our knowledge of pointers and structs while using function pointers.

## [Project Ox10-variadic_functions](https://github.com/aliavang/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x10-variadic_functions)
This project brings us to variadic functions. We learn about variadic funtions because it is laying the foundation for learning how to take in a variable amount of arguments without knowing how many arguments they will be. In the past, we had a finite amount of parameters, but this project teaches us that we can take in an undefined amount of parameters without listing them in our function's parameters. It is important, because it helps us learn how to solve cases in which we want user's input but are unsure of how many arguments they will pass over to us.

## [Project 0x12-singly_linked_lists](https://github.com/aliavang/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x12-singly_linked_lists)
This project introduces us to linked lists. We learn cases in which they are better than arrays and how to use them. It teaches us how to access elements in the linked lists as well as how to add nodes to the list.
