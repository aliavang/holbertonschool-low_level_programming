# holbertonschool-low_level_programming
In this repository, we learn all about C.

## [Project 0x00-hello_world](https://github.com/aliavang/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x00-hello_world)
This project introduces us to C and the process of GCC. It includes both shell script and C programming so that we can work with something we are familiar with before transitioning over to C. The shell scripts deals with the GCC process while the C programming we do transitions us to writing in the language of C.

## [Project 0x01-variables_if_else_while](https://github.com/aliavang/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while)
This project takes us deeper into the language of C. We begin coding more in C and no longer deal with shell scripts. In this project, we learn how to work with while loops and how to declare variables as well as how to assign them values.

## [Project 0x02-functions_nested_loops](https://github.com/aliavang/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops)
This project takes us even deeper into loops by having us work with nested loops. Although we had two mandatory tasks in the previous project that dealt with nested loops, this project will focus solely on nested loops, bringing us into the complexity that nested loops can create. We also briefly deal with header files by creating on which includes all our functions we use in the project.

## [Project 0x03-debugging](https://github.com/aliavang/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x03-debugging)
This project takes us into debugging our programs. Here, we learn how to go into our code and see where our code is going wrong. In doing so, we go behind the code and see the logic that is being performed to give us the correct output that we are searching for. We learn how to manually debug our code by following the logic and how to take a close look at our code.

## [Project 0x04-more_functions_nested_loops](https://github.com/aliavang/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops)
This project deals with more nested loops. Here, we are using nested loops to do various tasks for us such as printing tables and triangles. There are a few tasks that do not deal with nested loops, instead, it tasks us with single loops which brings us back to the basic of loops and what it does. By doing so, it refreshes our memories so that we do not forget what one single loop does versus two loops, with one nested inside the other.

## [Project 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings](https://github.com/aliavang/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings)
This project brings us into pointers, arrays, and strings. Building on our knowledge of loops and nested loops, we begin handling strings, arrays, and pointers as parameters. By working with pointers as our parameters, we learn that, while the concept of pointers is abstract, it is the same as being passed any kind of parameter. The difference is that we are not copying the parameters into our function, we are working directly with their value via being passed a pointer to them.

## [Project 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings](https://github.com/aliavang/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings)
This project focuses on more pointers, arrays, and strings. We build up on our knowledge from the previous project and work more with pointers.

## [Project 0x07-pointers_arrays_strings](https://github.com/aliavang/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings)
This project brings us more pointers. Although most of the tasks deal with pointers, we work a little with pointers-to-pointers and 2d arrays. Here, we expand our knowledge of pointers by learning what pointers to pointers are. Tossed in with pointers-to-pointers, are 2d arrays to demonstrate why pointer-to-pointers are used.
